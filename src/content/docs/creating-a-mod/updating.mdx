Updating a mod is really easy! Just please make sure you 
First go to your mainfest.json and change the version number:
```json
{
  "name": "Your_mod_name",
  "version_number": "1.1.0",
  "website_url": "https://peakmodding.github.io",
  "description": "A mod description",
  "dependencies": []
}
```

Then, rezip the mod like before and upload it! Super duper simple!

:::caution
The mod must be under the same community and team! You do not need to fill in the tags.
