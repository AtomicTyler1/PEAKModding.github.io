Modding might sound complicated, but it's much easier if you start with the right mindset and a simple mod.

:::note
Pirated versions of the game don't and never will support modding.
:::

## Install the Requirements

Before you can start modding PEAK, you’ll need to install two essential tools:

- **.NET SDK 8.0 or 9.0** – *This is needed so you can compile C# code.*
  - [Download .NET here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download)
- **IDE** – *This is where you'll write and build your code. Choosing one can depend on your preferences and system.*
  - [Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/#) (The best all-in-one)
  - [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) (Lightweight and customizable)
  - [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/) (Widely used in tutorials)

Now that you have .NET and an IDE, we can move on to creating your first mod.

:::caution
This guide will not cover setting up your IDE. If you're stuck at this point, try watching a video tutorial.

## Installing BepInEx

# Mod Manager

Download Gale from [here](https://thunderstore.io/c/peak/p/Kesomannen/GaleModManager/).   
Open the ZIP file, launch "`Gale_1.x.x_x64_en-US.msi`" and follow the standard installation steps   

Open Gale and find "Peak" in the list and install Gale  
Go to Thunderstore by the left sidebar and install BepinexExPack PEAK (pin on top on the list)   


:::note
If Gale is already installed, update it and click on the Among Us button to open the game list, then on the Peak button   
:::


# Manual

Install the PEAK-specific version of BepInEx from Thunderstore.  
You can download it from [here](https://thunderstore.io/c/peak/p/BepInEx/BepInExPack_PEAK/).

Unzip the BepInEx download, then copy all of its contents into PEAK’s game directory. You can find the game folder by going to:  
`Steam > Library > PEAK > Manage > Browse local files`

After copying the files, launch the game once so BepInEx can generate the necessary configuration files. You can then safely close the game.

:::note
If you've used BepInEx before, you may notice the console window doesn't appear — this is normal.  
PEAK can be unstable with the console enabled, and the reason is still unknown.

You **can** re-enable the console by opening `BepInEx/config/BepInEx.cfg` and setting `HideManagerGameObject = false`

## Installing a Decompiler

:::note
This step is optional but highly recommended if you want to understand or debug PEAK’s code.
:::

A decompiler allows you to inspect the game’s internal code. This helps you discover useful classes and methods that can be modified using Harmony.

You only need one decompiler. Recommended options:

- [ILSpy](https://github.com/icsharpcode/ILSpy)
- [dnSpy](https://github.com/dnSpyEx/dnSpy)
- [dotPeek](https://www.jetbrains.com/decompiler/#)

You’re now ready to move on:
