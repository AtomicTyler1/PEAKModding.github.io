:::note
This guide assumes you have a setup BepInEx plugin to use.
:::

Does your mod rely on another mod to function? Or do you want your mod to load after another mod? BepInDependacies are where you come in luck!
These are really simple to get the grasp of, so let's get to the hardest part which is still very easy!

## Getting a mod GUID

:::caution
If a mod GUID changes, you will have to re-find the mod GUID and update your mod accordingly.
:::

To depend on a mod, you need the GUID of it. Most of the time, this is easy to find. For this example, we will go through PEAKLib.Core.

<LinkCard
  title="PEAKLib.Core Source"
  href="https://thunderstore.io/c/peak/p/PEAKModding/PEAKLib_Core/source"
  description="The source code of PEAKLib."
/>

Ok there are a couple ways to do this, we will start with Method 1.

### Method 1

Go to the source tab on thunderstore of the desired mod. Then, use the find feature of your browser.

:::note
For windows 10 and 11 use **CTRL + F**
:::

Then search for `BepInPlugin`. Then look until you find something like this:

```c# title="PEAKLib.Core Source"
[BepInPlugin("com.github.PEAKModding.PEAKLib.Core", "PEAKLib.Core", "1.2.0")]
```

The first string is what we are after. So copy `com.github.PEAKModding.PEAKLib.Core` to your clipboard.
The mod GUID will be different for every mod, so check what yours is. If you successfully have the mod GUID you can skip Method 2.

### Method 2

:::caution
Only try this if Method 1 did not work for you.
:::

Still stay on the source tab of the mod, we are still going to use the find/search feature. This method is a bit more unreliable.
This time we are going to search for `com.`, this is because most mod GUID's use this formatting. **If you still cannot find it try using your own knowledge or asking people for help in the discord.**

## Coding the dependency

Now this is really simple. All you have to do is add one line below your BepInPlugin. Just replace `com.github.PEAKModding.PEAKLib.Core` with the GUID you got from the mod.

```c# title="Plugin.cs"
[BepInPlugin("com.yourname.yourmod", "Your Mod Name", "1.0.0")]
[BepInDependency("com.github.PEAKModding.PEAKLib.Core", BepInDependency.DependencyFlags.HardDependency)]
```

The final step is deciding whether your dependency should be a HardDependency or a SoftDependency.

Here’s how to choose:

- **`HardDependency`** → Your mod cannot function without the other mod.
- **`SoftDependency`** → Your mod works fine without it, but if the other mod is present, yours will load after it.
