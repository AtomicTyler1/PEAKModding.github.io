import { Badge, LinkCard } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

| Project Info | |
| --- | --- |
| Coding | <Badge text="Required" variant="danger" /> |
| Unity | <Badge text="Optional" variant="success" /> |
| Project Setup | <Badge text="Simple" variant="success" /> |
| Modding Libraries | <Badge text="PEAKLib.Stats" /> |

Uh oh! Roadblock.

For now, look for status effects in the PEAKLib.Tests project:

<LinkCard
  title="PEAKLib.Tests/Plugin.cs"
  href="https://github.com/PEAKModding/PEAKLib/blob/main/tests/PEAKLib.Tests/Plugin.cs"
  description="PEAKLib.Tests has two status effects which can be used as reference"
  target="_blank"
/>
